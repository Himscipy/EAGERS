% This function runs a single optimization over the horizon of the dispatch optimization
% date is a vector of timestamps representing the points in time to be forecast and optimized
% last_solution is optional. If it is not empty, [], it is a structure of the solution 1 step prior
% It returns solution, a structure organizing the generator setpoints, line
% transfer flow, excess heat rejected, and hydro state of charge, and it
% returns the forecast that was optimized.
% If the Optimization has not been run previously it loads the optimization
% matrices and automatically determines an initial condition. If it has
% been run previously it uses the end point of a prior solution that is
% closest to the first date in ForecastTime as the initial condition. 
% This function then generates a forecast of the demands and optimizes
% according to that forecast.
